# LoupedeckNewFormat

The purpose of this project is to reproduce the functionality for the sample plugin project provided by the Loupedesk SDK, 
but utilizing the Microsoft SDK project format, allowing plugin development with Visual Studio Code.

Notes will be included in this file for specific items that will have to be manually changed to turn this into a starting point
for your own plugin development.

This initial commit contains the plugin project as created by the official Loupedeck SDK tool.
